Black–Scholes Options Pricing Engine with Real NIFTY Data

This project implements a real-market options pricing and volatility analysis engine using the Black–Scholes framework. It calculates Greeks, estimates implied volatility from market prices, and visualizes the IV smile using real NIFTY option data. This is the type of analysis used in quantitative trading, derivatives research, and risk-management desks.
